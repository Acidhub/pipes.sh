It was also later posted to [Gist](https://gist.github.com/msimpson/1096939) with a license clarification (\"public domain\").\r\n\r\nIn early 2013 @livibetter posted a modification of the script to [Gist](https://gist.github.com/livibetter/4689307) after reading\r\nabout it on a [blog](http://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/pipes-sh-a-little-bit-of-fun/) where it was maintained for a few months.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 the script was given its own GitHub repo which encouraged contributions\r\nfrom other developers. As the script gained more popularity the decision was made\r\nto combine forces with developers of similar projects (such as this C version).\r\nFinally, in 2015 the [Pipeseroni](https://github.com/pipeseroni) collective was formed.\r\n\r\nIn 05/06/2015 [AcidHub](mailto:acidhub@craft.net.br) with his [BlackXT](https://github.com/BlackXT) GitHub account forked this project and \r\nmade the git as light as possible only for archive purposes.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\n* Bash 4+.\r\n\r\nOptions\r\n=======\r\n\r\n    -p [1-]        number of pipes (D=1).\r\n    -t [0-8]       type of pipes, can be used more than once (D=0).\r\n    -t c[16 chars] custom type of pipes.\r\n    -f [20-100]    framerate (D=75).\r\n    -s [5-15]      probability of a straight fitting (D=13).\r\n    -r LIMIT       reset after x characters, 0 if no limit (D=2000).\r\n    -R             random starting point.\r\n    -B             no bold effect.\r\n    -C             no color.\r\n    -h             help.\r\n    -v             print version number.\r\n\r\nControls\r\n========\r\n\r\nPress any key to exit the program.\r\n\r\nContribution\r\n============\r\n\r\nFeel free to fork and/or create pull request.
